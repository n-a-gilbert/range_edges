## Abstract
Poleward and uphill range shifts are a common but variable response to anthropogenic climate change. We lack understanding regarding this interspecific variation in range-shifting; for example, functional traits (e.g., body size, diet) show weak or mixed ability to predict range shifts. Characteristics of species’ ranges may better enable prediction of range shifts; for instance, species with larger geographic ranges are more likely to show range shifts. However, the explanatory power of other range characteristics—especially within-range abundance patterns—remain untested. Here, we introduce a hypothesis framework for understanding range-limit population trends and range shifts via the internal structure of the geographic range, specifically range edge hardness (i.e., abundance within range edges relative to the rest of the range). The dispersal hypothesis predicts that, through dispersal mechanisms, high edge abundance facilitates expansions along the leading edge but creates inertia at the trailing edge such that the range limit recedes slowly. In contrast, the limitation hypothesis suggests that hard range edges are the signature of strong limits (e.g., biotic interactions) that force faster contraction of the trailing edge but block expansions at the leading edge of the range. Using a long-term avian monitoring dataset from northern Minnesota, USA, we estimated population trends for 35 trailing-edge species and 18 leading-edge species and modeled their population trends as a function of range edge hardness calculated from state-of-the-art abundance maps from eBird data. Trailing-edge species with harder range edges were more likely to be declining, demonstrating moderate support for the limitation hypothesis. In contrast, leading-edge species with harder range edges were slightly more likely to be increasing, demonstrated weak support for the dispersal hypothesis. These opposing results for the leading and trailing range edges suggest that different mechanisms may underpin range expansions and contractions, respectively. As data and state-of-the-art modeling efforts continue to proliferate, we will be ever better equipped to map abundance patterns within species’ ranges, offering opportunities to anticipate range shifts through the lens of the geographic range.
